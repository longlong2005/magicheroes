BugsAndIssues.Description:Log In to App\n\nCreate Account on kabam.com\nRecover Account on New Device/After Deleting App\n\nIn KoC: Battle for the North players are limited to one profile per iDevice. By logging in to the app Players are able to continue their progress on any compatible iDevice!\n \nTo Log In (New players who create an account on kabam.com will receive 75 Free Gems):\nTap on your Player Name > the 'Cog' icon > Kabam ID\nEnter the Email and Password you created on kabam.com\n \nTo Log Out:\nDelete the App and reinstall from the App Store\nLog back in by following the Log In step above\n \nUrgent Notice! Deleting the App will erase your previous player data. Do not Delete the App unless you already have your account linked to kabam.com. Also make sure you remember your Email and Password before doing so.\n \nHelpful Tips:\n\nWant to start over? Log out of the App by deleting and reinstalling it. In order to start a new account and continue your progress on another iDevice you will need a new kabam.com profile. Logging in with your old account info will bring back your old account \n \nNeed to change your Password? If you happen to forget your Password you can reset it by going to kabam.com and entering your Email address and then clicking the “Forgot Password” link (after tapping the “Log In” link).\n\n\nMarch Stuck “Fighting”\n\nSome players have noticed their Trusty Troops like to fight a little longer than necessary. Maybe they’ve made new friends and are sharing a pint at the Tavern? Whatever the case, if you experience an issue with stuck “fighting” or “unloading” Troops in the future we suggest you refresh the app. You can refresh the app by tapping on your Player Name > ‘?’ > Force App Refresh. This should clear up any of the stuck “Fighting” marches!\n\nDeconstruct/Destroy\n\nThere has been some confusion surrounding these functions. Hopefully these answers address your questions!\n\nIn order to Deconstruct (slowly being Demolished) or Destroy (Instantly Demolished using Dragon Stomp item) your building queue must be empty. Wait for your Build to finish (or use items) before you attempt to Deconstruct/Destroy.\n\nAlso, certain buildings cannot be Deconstructed or Destroyed:\n\nCastle\nKnight's Hall\nRally Point\nWatch Tower\nRound Tower (will be used for exciting features in the future)\n\nThe Embassy cannot be Deconstructed or Destroyed while you are in an Alliance and the same goes for Barracks while Troops are in the Training queue.\n\nOne last tip: Level 1 (one) buildings cannot be Destroyed, they can only be Deconstructed (which is pretty much instant anyways)!\n\nUnable to Claim Resource Quest Reward\n\n\nBeginner’s Offer\n\nOur Newest Knights would be silly not to take advantage of our “Beginner’s Offer.” The Beginner's Offer states: “Free Chest worth 500 Gems with your first purchase.” This Chest of items (worth 500 gems) can be found by tapping on Items > My Items > Chest.\n\nWe do our best to introduce new offers and promotions often. Please read these offer details carefully to avoid any misunderstandings in the future!

IngameHelp.AlchemyLab_Subtitle1:Research
IngameHelp.AlchemyLab_Text1:In Battle for the North, you can Research Technologies in the Alchemy Lab to advance Resource production, increase your effectiveness in Combat, decrease Construction time and more!
IngameHelp.Barracks_Subtitle1:Units/Troops
IngameHelp.Barracks_Subtitle2:Unit stats
IngameHelp.Barracks_Subtitle3:Unit Types and Modifiers
IngameHelp.Barracks_Subtitle4:Knights and Research
IngameHelp.Barracks_Subtitle5:Hide Troop Option
IngameHelp.Barracks_Text1:Your Troops are used to protect your City from being plundered, and for attacking Wilds, Pict camps as well as other Players. Each Troop has a Might value that contributes to your overall 'Might' in the game. Increase your Might to show others you are the strongest and mightiest Knight in the North!
IngameHelp.Barracks_Text2:Each unit in the game has stats that you can see by opening the Barracks. Here is what they mean:\n\n    * Attack: This is how much damage each unit can deal\n    * Life: This is how much damage each unit can absorb before it is destroyed\n    * Speed: This stat determines how long it takes that unit to march to another point on the map\n    * Load: This is how much resource or gold each unit can take back to your city if an attack is successful.\n\n\nUnits are divided into 3 tiers, troops in higher tiers have stronger stats and are more powerful.\n\n    * Tier 1 (Militiamen, Archers, Light Cavalry, Supply Troop)\n    * Tier 2 (Swordsmen, Ballistae, Cavalry, Supply Cart)\n    * Tier 3 (Battering Ram, Catapults, Heavy Cavalry, Supply Wagon)
IngameHelp.Barracks_Text3:There are 4 distinct types of units in each tier, each tier has 1 troop from each combat type:\n\n    * Ground (Militiamen, Swordsmen, Battering Ram)\n    * Artillery (Archers, Ballistae, Catapults)\n    * Cavalry (Light Cavalry, Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry)\n    * Supply (Supply Troop, Supply Cart, Supply Wagon)\n\nThe unit types all have specified strengths and weaknesses against each other (with the exception of Supply troops which have no attacking power).\n\nArtillery Troops have bonus against Ground Troops;\n\nGround Troops have bonus against Cavalry Troops;\n\nCavalry Troops have bonus against Artillery Troops.\n\nHigher tier troops will defeat lower tier troops even if they are weak against the opposing troop type.
IngameHelp.Barracks_Text4:The level of your Knights and research can also impact the outcome of a battle. Specifically, the higher the level of the Knight assigned to march, and the level of your Poisoned Edge and Healing Potions, the better your chance of winning.
IngameHelp.Barracks_Text5:The Hide Troops feature is located inside your Castle. You can turn on Hide Troops if you would like to avoid losing Troop when you are under attack, this allows you to build up your Troops and fight another day.\n\nDefending with troops can significantly increase your defensive capabilities, but is a risky strategy because troops defending can be destroyed by a superior attacker, and because the value of your troops might be greater than the value of the resources that could be looted.

IngameHelp.Castle_Overview:(DO NOT USE)
IngameHelp.Castle_Subtitle1:Tax Rate and Happiness
IngameHelp.Castle_Subtitle2:Hide Troop Option
IngameHelp.Castle_Subtitle3:Beginner’s Protection
IngameHelp.Castle_Text1:Gold is required for a variety of in-game activities including Researching, and paying salary to Knights assigned to positions.\n\nYour Tax Rate determines the amount of Gold you collect from your Citizens; the higher it is the more Gold you collect. Be careful though, the lower the Happiness of your City the less Idle Population you will have at your disposal. (see Population Help in Cottage)
IngameHelp.Castle_Text2:The Hide Troops feature is located inside your Castle. You can turn on Hide Troops if you would like to avoid losing Troop when you are under attack, this allows you to build up your Troops and fight another day.\n\nDefending with troops can significantly increase your defensive capabilities, but is a risky strategy because troops defending can be destroyed by a superior attacker, and because the value of your troops might be greater than the value of the resources that could be looted.
IngameHelp.Castle_Text3:Every new player will be granted a protection period during which they cannot attack, be attacked or scouted by other players. This period lasts for your first 7 days, or until your Castle reaches level 5, whichever comes first. Use this period to build up your city and troops to better prepare for battle!\n\nYou may put your troops to test by attacking Pictish Camps and unoccupied Wilds. You may opt out of the Beginner's protection before the 7 days are up.\n\nOnce your beginner's protection has worn off, your cities can be attacked by other players in the game. Cities can be defended by two types of units: Wall Defenses and Troops.\n\nYou may extend this peace period or declare peace at anytime by purchasing the Dove of Peace item in the Shop.
IngameHelp.Conquests_Subtitle1:Surveying
IngameHelp.Conquests_Text1:With the Survey feature you can explore Wilds you have conquered in search of Treasure Chests  containing precious stones. These precious stones can later be redeemed for valuable prizes during in-game events. \n\n\n\nTo Survey a Wild: \n\n\n. Reach Player Level 15. \n\n\n2. Conquer a Wild (or use on that you already own). Note: Only Hills, Mountains, Grasslands, and Woods can be Surveyed.  \n\n\n3. Encamp at least one Knight and Troops on the Wild. \n\n\n4. Tap the shovel icon next to the Wild you would like to Survey on the March tab at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n5. Wait for Surveying to complete or speed it up!\n\n\n6. When the Survey has completed, tap 'Collect' to the right of the Wild on the March tab. \n\n7. A 'You've collected..' message appears. You now have a Treasure Chest that may or may not contain precious stones. \nIf you want to ensure you get at least 1 precious stone in the chest, you can use a Gemcutter's Assay item when you open it. Otherwise, tap 'Collect' to see what's inside. \n\n8. You can now view your precious stones in the Treasure inventory tab of the Storehouse building, and can redeem them for awesome prizes. \n\n9. After a Wild is surveyed, it needs some recovery time before it can be Surveyed again. You can wait for the Wild to recover or speed up the recovery and then Survey again!
IngameHelp.Cottage_Subtitle1:Population
IngameHelp.Cottage_Text1:Population consists of the people in your City.\n\nBuilding Cottages adds to the Population Limit, which is the maximum number of people a player is able to have in their City at one time. The happier the Population, the closer the Population value will come to the Population limit. \n\nYou can boost your Population to the limit temporarily by using the “Fertile Winds” item.\n\nIdle Population is the number of people available to put to work in Fields and to train for Troops. Idle population still contributes to tax income.

IngameHelp.RallyPoint_Subtitle4:Combat Mechanics
IngameHelp.RallyPoint_Subtitle5:Attack and Scout
IngameHelp.RallyPoint_Text1:Marches are how you move around on the World Map.  There are 3 types of Marches: Attack, Reinforce, and Transport. \n\nAttack: You can attack Wilds, Pict Camps as well as other Players. Each Attack must be led by a Knight. The amount of troops that you can send and the number of simultaneous marches are determined by the level of your Rally Point. \n\nReinforce: You can reinforce Wilds that you own as well as cities of Alliance members. Remember, reinforced troops will consume food resource when in Alliance cities. The number of armies allowed to reinforce an Alliance city is determined by the level of the Embassy in that city.\n\nTransport: Show some love and support an Alliance member by transporting resources to them. Transport marches do not require a Knight. 
IngameHelp.RallyPoint_Text2:Helps you learn vital information about locations on the Map. Scouting is free, but you are limited to launching one Scout at a time and it does take time for information to be collected. Research higher levels of Eagle Eyes to yield more information on each Scout. Alternately, you can purchase Instant Scout with Gems, which produces Scout reports with information equivalent to level 10 Eagle Eyes.
IngameHelp.RallyPoint_Text3:The World Map is where the action is at.  Attack and conquer wilds, loot Pict camps, and attack enemies or help friends.   \n\nUsing the World Map:  Swipe your finger to move around the World Map.  Tap on an individual tile to bring up that tile’s details, tap the tile again to close the details pop-up.  Tap with two fingers to toggle on/off individual tile levels.   The buttons at the top of the screen allow you to (from left): Center the map on your city, open your saved Bookmarks, and jump to specific coordinates on the map.  \n\nThere are three types of map tiles on the World Map:  Wilds, Pict Camps, and Cities.  \n\nWilds help boost your resource production.  Different wilds boost different resources, for example, owning a level 6 Grassland will boost your food production by 30%.  To own a Wild, you must attack it and win the battle.  You can only own a limited number of Wilds, upgrade your Castle to own more.  You can abandon a Wild that you own by going to the Castle.\n\nPict Camps are owned by the evil King Drust.  Attack them and return home with valuable resources!  Higher level Pict Camps are harder to beat, but also hold more resources.  You cannot own a Pict Camp.  \n\nCities represent other users in the game.  If you are in an Alliance, your Alliance cities will be displayed with a blue flag, hostile alliances will have a red flag displayed.
IngameHelp.RallyPoint_Text4:In Battle for the North, players can train troops and use them to attack Wilds, Pict Camps, and other players. Conquering Wilds can help boost your resource production, while attacking Pict Camps and other players can be a good source of additional resources.
IngameHelp.RallyPoint_Text5:How to send out an attack:\n\n   1. Find your target in the map view\n   2. Tap on that tile\n   3. Tap 'Attack'\n   4. Choose the Knight you would like to use\n   5. Choose the type and amount of troops that you would like to March \n   6. Select Use or Buy combat boost items if desired \n   7. Tap 'Attack'\n   8. You may tap on Speed Up, Instant Finish March or wait for your troops to reach the target.\n   9. After the troops are done fighting, you will receive a battle report inside your Mail, under Report. \n\n\n\nYou may also choose to first scout and better learn about your target before attack. Scout reports are placed inside your Mail, under Reports, remember, you can gather more information by researching higher levels of Eagle Eyes.
IngameHelp.Reliefstation_Subtitle1:Relief Station
IngameHelp.Reliefstation_Text1:The Relief Station increases your troops' march speed between your cities and to your allies' cities.

IngameHelp.Storehouse_Text1:Resources are used to upgrade Buildings, build Troops and complete Research. There are five main resources: Food, Wood, Stone, Ore, and Gold.\n\nFood, Wood, Stone, and Ore are produced by Farms, Sawmills, Quarries, and Mines, respectively. Your Resource production can be increased by building more Field plots, conquering Wilds, appointing a Knight to the Steward position, conducting Research, and also by using Production Boost items.\n\nAll of the above resources (except Gold) can be protected by your Storehouse. The higher level the Storehouse, the higher the protection limit.\n\nGold is produced by Taxing your Population, increasing the number and level of Cottages can help lead to more Gold. You may adjust your Tax rate in your Castle.\n\nResources can be transferred to Alliance members, or between your own cities.
IngameHelp.Wall_Subtitle1:Defense Troops in Wall
IngameHelp.Wall_Text1:Defense Troops in Wall\n\nWall Defenses are used to Defend your City from incoming attacks. Building up your Wall Defenses is a good way to defend your city, boost your Power and intimidate other players in the game.\n\nThese Defenses are not Troops, but they do have their own Might Values. Unlike Troops these Defenses cannot be set to 'Hide' or 'Defend;' they are always 'active.'\n\nSimilar to troops in your Barracks, Wall Defenses are divided into 3 different types:\n\n    * Ground (Caltrops, Spiked Barrier, Persian Sulfur)\n    *  Artillery (Traps, Boiling Oil, Greek Fire)\n    * Horse (Wall-mounted Crossbows, Defensive Trebuchet, Hellfire Thower)\n\nThe same modifiers apply in combat:\n\nArtillery Defenses have bonus against Ground Troops;\n\nGround Defenses have bonus against Cavalry Troops;\n\nCavalry Defenses have bonus against Artillery Troops.

March.newUserPict4:You think you can defeat my more than 500 troops?  Take your best shot. \n
March.newUserPict5:Us Picts joke that Southern Knights cannot count. There are more than 700 troops here who will happily confirm this. \n
March.newUserPict6:Drust here, I grow tired of you and your silly attacks.   Surely you have enough troops to challenge my thousand troops?\n

March.newUserWild2:I have more feathers in my cape than you have troops.   Try again when you've got a couple hundred troops.\n
March.newUserWild3:You see this smirk on my face?  That’s what I think of your army.   Come back when you think you can beat my almost 300 troops.\n
March.newUserWild4:You must be new around here, that must be why you think you can defeat my more than 500 troops.  \n
March.newUserWild5:I'm going to wipe your army out as easily as I wipe blue paint on my face.   This wild is protected by almost 1000 of my loyal followers\n
March.newUserWild6:If you want to control this Wild, you'll have to do better than this.   Over a thousand troops guard this Wild.\n
March.newUserWild7:Drust here, feeling ambitious are we?  Over 2000 of my troops are waiting to put you in your place.\n
March.newUserWild8:Don't go crying home to Mama when you see over 3000 of my troops waiting for you here.\n

Messages.NewUserTip1Message:Mighty Knight,\nLocated at the bottom of the screen, Quests are assignments that will guide and reward you as your progress in the game.  Tap the Quests icon to review the list of available Quests.  Once you’ve fulfilled a quest you’ll be rewarded with resources or items. To claim this bounty, tap the blue “Claim” button. You can also tap on the arrow on the right to review the Quest Reward and understand what you’ll be given. Once you’re satisfied, press Claim, and the loot will automatically be placed in your inventory.\n\nUpon gathering the goods and scrolling through the Quest list, you may observe at the top of the list the “Recommended” quest. Following the Recommended Quests will help you establish a healthy domain in record time, ensuring an adequate flow of resources, a respectable variety of buildings and troops, and a satisfied population to accompany it all.  If you’re ever unsure of what to do next, let the Recommended Quests guide your way.\n\nRemember, you are in Beginners’ Protection for only 7 days, so use this time wisely to grow as powerful as you can!
Messages.NewUserTip1Subject:The Quests System
Messages.NewUserTip2Message:Mighty Knight,\nResources include Food, Wood, Stone, and Ore. All four are produced in your Fields.  The hourly production is the amount you produce per hour. With food, the troop’s upkeep shows how much food your troops are eating each hour. \n\nYour base production is based on the number and level of your resource production buildings. Your gross production reflects the total rate of production after production boosts from Wildernesses and Items have been applied.\n\nYou can see your base production, with a breakdown of the bonuses adding to the gross production, by clicking on your Castle > Overview > Production > White Arrow on the Right\n\nResources replenish based on their hourly production (minus upkeep for food). Upgrading your fields increase your long term production, also assigning a Knight to be your Steward and completing appropriate research will also increase production.\n\nIn the short term, you can increase production using items from your Items tab (gained by completing Quests or spending Gems) or attacking appropriate Wilds and Pictish Camps!
Messages.NewUserTip2Subject:Understanding Resource’s Production
Messages.NewUserTip3Message:"Good Knight,\nNo one can prosper without resources, and whenever your domain is under attack, that is precisely what your foes will attempt to steal. A well-fortified Storehouse will protect a certain quantity of resources (except Gold). As you upgrade your Storehouse its capacity will increase, enabling you to protect more resources and discouraging attacks. Also, research Shrinking Powder in your Alchemy Lab! This will increase your Srorehouse capacity by 10% per level.\n\nTo thwart looters, keep your resource totals within your Storehouse capacity. You can check this by tapping the Resource Bar near the top of the screen and looking for Protection Limit near the top right. You can send any excess to an Alliance member to protect for you. If you are not in Alliance, join the best one you can.\n\nGold is not protected. The best ways to protect it are to spend it on research, or send it to an Alliance member to protect it for you. Allies can always send resources back as required."
Messages.NewUserTip3Subject:The importance of the Storehouse
Messages.NewUserTip4Message:Mighty Knight,\nStrength lies in numbers! Alliances are groups of Lords and Ladies pledged to help each other in times of War and Peace. Expert Players often attack lower level players to loot them of their resources. Joining an Alliance is the best deterrent against “Farming” until your Army is strong enough to resist enemy’s troops. \n\nIf showing your Alliance muscles didn’t work and some foes looted your city ask your alliance for help. They will share resources with you will be able you to rebuild much faster! As we learned yesterday, you can send resources and gold to Alliance’s Members if you are under attack and if you have more resources than the Storehouse can protect. They will send them back when your city is out of danger.\n\nBut most important, Alliances are a lot of fun! You will make friends and socialize with other Players from all over the World strategizing and planning Attacks to Rival Alliances and joining forces with Friendly ones.
Messages.NewUserTip4Subject:Join an Alliance now!
Messages.NewUserTip5Message:Mighty Knight,\nIf you think your army is strong enough to resist any attack or defeat any level of Wilds or Pictish Camps, well... think again!\n\nThe one week of Beginner Protection is almost over and you will soon experience how dangerous these Northern Territories of Camelot can be. Don’t despair, you can fight smart and minimize losses, your time will come soon!\n\nFirst and foremost: Hide your Troops in the Castle! Hidden Troops are safe from attack, but cannot defend your City and its Resources. By default your Troops are NOT hidden in the Castle, keep them safe for now and concentrate on upgrading the Storehouse to protect your Resources.\n\nTo manage the Hide All Troops Feature tap on your Castle > Overview > Hide All Troops on/off at the bottom of the page
Messages.NewUserTip5Subject:Don’t doom your Troops to certain death!
Messages.NewUserTip6Message:Mighty Knight,\nYou came to the North to fight against your enemies and protect Camelot from the Pictish threat - and to do that, you will need a powerful army! \n\nTraining a strong army takes time, but there are few things you can do to accelerate the process.\n\nBuilding more Barracks will speed up training time. Upgrade your Barracks to train more powerful troops. Research Geometry in the Alchemy Lab to increase the speed of training by 10% per level. \n\nTo Research Geometry tap on the Alchemy Lab > Research > Geometry!\n\nRead the requirements and do whatever is necessary to meet them.
Messages.NewUserTip6Subject:Build more Barracks and Train Troops Faster!
Messages.NewUserTip7Message:Mighty Knight,\nThis is a game that rewards constant attention but most likely you can’t play 24/7 … can you? Push Notifications will help you keep an eye on your Kingdom when you are not actively playing.\n\nTo allow Push Notifications go to your iOS device Settings Menu, select Notifications and switch ON notifications for Camelot.\n\nAfter this, to Manage Push Notifications in the game, tap on your name > then on “The Cog” on the top right of the screen > Push Notifications\n\nYou’ll notice that there are 3 Categories of Push Notifications:\n“City Notifications” will alert you when a Building, a Technology a Training has been completed so you can timely come back into the game and start another one.\n\n“March Notification” will let you know when a march you sent out has arrived to destination or has returned to your city.\n\n“Mail Notification” will let you know when you received a new mail or report.\n\nYou can manage these 3 Categories of Push Notifications independently and personalize this feature according to what’s more relevant for you and your style of game-play!
Messages.NewUserTip7Subject:The advantages of activating Push Notifications
Messages.WelcomeMessage:Welcome to Kingdoms of Camelot: Battle for the North!\n\nWelcome to the North, good and noble Knight! Your presence makes me feel safer already. Since my husband King Lot fell in battle, Drust of the Picts has let his bloodthirsty savages run wild across the land!\n\nThere is much to do:\n- Build and Upgrade your Buildings\n- Produce Resources \n- Research New Technology\n- Train your Troops for battle!\n\nBeginner's Protection prevents you from being attacked for 7 days, or until your Castle reaches level 5. Use this time wisely and build up your defenses! For increased power and protection, join an Alliance or create your own.\n\nNeed help? Follow the Recommended Quest. Visit the Quest page now -- there's no time to lose!
